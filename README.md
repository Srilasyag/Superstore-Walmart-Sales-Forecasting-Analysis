# Superstore-Walmart-Sales-Forecasting-Analysis
# Project Introduction:
Every department store chain wants to predict the store sales in the nearby future so that they can plan for inventory. Sales prediction helps increase/decrease store staff base on the rush. 
More sales indicate that there are more customers coming to the store. Sales and revenue forecasting will help to better understand a company’s cash flow and overall growth.
To plan for inventory, it is important to know what products or category of products will be utilized more. Understocking can occur, and sales are affected. Overstock items such as perishables and loss can occur due to loss and product expiry. 
Sales Prediction is done at a combination of store and department level and also at product level for high selling products.
In this project (walmart_sales.ipynb)  the sales data includes 45 stores based on store, department, and week. The size and type of each store is provided. Holiday weeks have been marked. Along with this, price markdown data (discount data) has been given. A few macro indicators such as CPI, Unemployment rate, Fuel Price etc. are also provided.

Project Concepts:

•	Understand the problem Statement clearly and how it is applicable to the scenario of Sales Forecasting.

•	Perform basic EDA to familiarize with the data.

•	Take care of missing values and datatype issues in the data.

•	Understand unique key in different data and Merging the data.

•	Perform Univariate analysis for both numeric and categorical variables. 

•	Plot trend of each predictor with target variable 

•	Do an in-depth analysis on the impact of Date/Week on Sales

•	Create new features that might add value to model.

•	Define a function for each set of code that might need to be repeated again. 

•	Prepare the data for modelling.

•	Make prediction using statistical techniques.

•	Make model using machine learning techniques.

•	Create time series ARIMA models and learn to give their parameters.

•	Perform Hyper-parameter tuning to get the best parameters.

•	Learn how to make predictions where data is sparse.

•	Compare the performance of different models using multiple metrics.
